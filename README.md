## The provenance of the data
The [orginal dataset](original_dataset) used is created by Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil & Lee (2011) and includes movie metadata. The dataset was constructed by extracting movie scripts from publicly available websites and linking these to IMDB movie data for their study on conversational adaptation mechanisms of characters in movies.
